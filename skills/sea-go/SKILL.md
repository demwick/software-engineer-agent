# /sea-go

Advance the project by one phase. Announce at the start: **"Using the go skill to run the next phase."**

Argument: $ARGUMENTS (optional — a phase number, or empty = next pending phase)

## Step 1: Preconditions

1. Check `.sea/state.json` and `.sea/roadmap.md` exist.
   - If missing → tell the user *"No project state found. Run /sea-init first."* and stop.
2. Read both files.

## Step 2: Pick the Phase

- If $ARGUMENTS is a number → use that phase (error out if it's already done or doesn't exist).
- Otherwise → use the first phase whose status is `pending` or `in-progress`.
- If every phase is `done` → celebrate briefly and tell the user the project is complete. Stop.

Show the user: *"Starting Phase N: <name>"* before continuing.

## Step 3: Plan the Phase (if no plan yet)

Check `.sea/phases/phase-N/plan.md`.

- **Plan exists** → read it, skip to Step 4.
- **No plan** → launch the `planner` agent in **Mode B (Phase Planning)**. Pass the roadmap entry for Phase N as context. The planner writes `.sea/phases/phase-N/plan.md`.

Read the plan. If it contains any `[[ ASK: ... ]]` markers, surface those questions to the user and stop. Do not guess.

## Step 4: Choose the Pipeline

The plan's "Complexity" line tells you which pipeline to run:

| Complexity | Pipeline |
|------------|----------|
| trivial | `executor` only |
| medium | `executor` only (verifier runs via Stop hook) |
| complex | `researcher` → `executor` (verifier runs via Stop hook) |

For **complex** only: before calling executor, launch the `researcher` agent with the plan's context section to gather any deep knowledge the executor will need. Read the report yourself — do not dump it to the user.

## Step 5: Execute

Before launching, check `.sea/phases/phase-N/progress.json`:

- **Exists** → read it. The phase was interrupted mid-execution. Tell the user *"Resuming Phase N from task <current_task> (tasks <completed_tasks> already done)."*
- **Absent** → fresh start.

Launch the `executor` agent. Pass it:
- The path to the plan file
- The plan's context section
- Any researcher findings (for complex phases)
- **Resume context** if `progress.json` existed: *"Skip tasks <completed_tasks>; resume at task <current_task>."*

Wait for executor to finish. It returns `STATUS: done` or `STATUS: blocked`.

- **blocked** → surface executor's report to the user verbatim, mark the phase `in-progress` in state.json, stop.
- **done** → arm auto-QA (next step).

## Step 6: Arm the Auto-QA Hook

Before your response ends, run this from the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p .sea && echo 0 > .sea/.needs-verify
```

This creates the `.needs-verify` marker file. The `Stop` hook (`hooks/auto-qa`) checks for this marker when your response finishes. If it exists:

1. The hook auto-detects the project's test runner via `scripts/detect-test.sh`
2. Runs the tests
3. On **pass** → clears the marker, Claude stops normally
4. On **fail** → returns `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}`, Claude automatically continues to fix the failures (up to 2 retries, then the hook gives up)

You do NOT invoke the verifier agent manually. The hook handles it. Trust the hook.

If the project has no test runner, the hook auto-passes silently — fine for `/sea-quick` work and very early MVPs.

## Step 7: Update State and Report

On verifier success:

1. Update `.sea/state.json` via the `state-update.sh` helper — **never write state.json directly with Write/Edit**. The helper jq-merges, preserves required fields (`schema_version`, `mode`, `created`), auto-refreshes `last_session`, and validates the result:
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state-update.sh" \
       current_phase=<N+1> \
       last_commit=<short-sha-of-HEAD>
   ```
   Pass any additional fields as extra `KEY=VALUE` args. JSON-parseable values (numbers, booleans, arrays) keep their type; everything else becomes a string.
2. Update `.sea/roadmap.md`: mark Phase N as `done`.
3. Write a short summary to `.sea/phases/phase-N/summary.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Phase N Summary
   Completed: <ISO now>
   Commits: <count>
   Files touched: <list>
   Notes: <2-3 sentences>
   ```
4. Tell the user:
   > Phase N complete. Next: Phase N+1 "<name>". Run `/sea-go` when ready.

## Rules

- **Do not skip the planner** for medium/complex phases, even if the phase "looks obvious". The plan is the contract the executor works against.
- **Do not run verifier yourself** — the Stop hook does it. Calling it manually creates a double-verification loop.
- **Respect blockers** — if executor reports `blocked`, do not try to unstick it; surface it to the user.
- **One phase per /sea-go invocation.** Do not chain phases.
- **Never delete or rewrite commits** the executor made. If something's wrong, the next phase or a `/sea-quick` fixes it.
